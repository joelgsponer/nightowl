**Statistical visualization and analysis toolkit for clinical research applications.**

A comprehensive R package providing declarative plotting, survival analysis, and interactive visualizations specifically designed for clinical research workflows. Built on a modern R6 architecture with three main classes:

- **`Plot`**: Declarative plotting system with SVG rendering and interactive HTML output
- **`Summary`**: Statistical summaries with embedded visualizations and reactable tables  
- **`Coxph`**: Cox proportional hazards modeling for survival analysis

## Why nightowl?

- **üè• Clinical Research Focus**: Purpose-built for clinical research workflows and regulatory requirements
- **üìä R6 Architecture**: Modern object-oriented design with method chaining for fluent interfaces
- **‚ö∞Ô∏è Survival Analysis**: Built-in Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards modeling
- **üìã Statistical Summaries**: Comprehensive `summarise_*` family of functions for clinical data
- **üéØ Interactive Elements**: SVG rendering with hover effects and reactable tables
- **üé® YAML Styling**: 14+ predefined plot styles with customizable configuration system

## Quick Start

### Basic Statistical Summaries

```r
library(nightowl)
library(survival)

# Create statistical summary with embedded visualization
summary_table <- Summary$new(
  data = veteran, 
  column = "karno", 
  group_by = "celltype",
  method = summarise_numeric_pointrange
)$reactable()

# Categorical summary with percentages  
treatment_summary <- Summary$new(
  data = veteran,
  column = "trt", 
  group_by = "celltype",
  method = summarise_categorical_with_total
)$kable()
```

### Survival Analysis

```r
# Kaplan-Meier survival curves
km_plot <- plot_km(
  data = veteran,
  time = "time",
  event = "status", 
  treatment = "trt",
  title = "Overall Survival by Treatment"
)

# Cox proportional hazards analysis
cox_model <- Coxph$new(
  data = veteran,
  time = "time",
  event = "status",
  treatment = "trt", 
  covariates = c("karno", "age"),
  group_by = "celltype"
)

# Generate forest plot for results
cox_model$forest_plot()
```

### Interactive Visualizations

```r
# Any ggplot2 can be made interactive
library(ggplot2)
my_plot <- ggplot(veteran, aes(karno, time, color = factor(trt))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Performance vs Survival Time")

# Convert to interactive SVG with hover effects
Plot$new(my_plot, options_svg = list(width = 8, height = 6))$html()
```

### Method Chaining and Fluent Interfaces

```r
# Chain multiple operations elegantly
result <- Summary$new(veteran, "karno", group_by = "celltype")$
  add_calculation(list(Missing = function(x) sum(is.na(x))))$
  reactable(
    options = list(
      searchable = TRUE,
      pagination = FALSE
    )
  )
```

## Security

This package includes comprehensive security vulnerability scanning for R dependencies:

- **Automated scanning** via GitHub Actions on every push and weekly schedules
- **Local security checks** using `source("inst/scripts/security-check.R")`
- **CI/CD integration** that fails builds on critical vulnerabilities
- **Multiple scanning tools**: oysteR, OSV Scanner, and riskmetric

See [`inst/SECURITY.md`](inst/SECURITY.md) for detailed security policy and scanning procedures.
